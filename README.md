**ANNOUNCEMENT: Talespire bug-reports are moving to** https://talespire.hellonext.co/b/Bug-Reports

Bugs already reported here will be addressed, but we will be slowly deprecating this issue tracker in favor of the new one.

Hi, thanks for taking the time to come and report an issue!

-----------------------------------------

To ensure your issue can be fixed please follow the issue template and provide all the steps you can so we know exactly how to recreate the problem. The easier it is to recreate, the easier it is for it to be fixed (usually anyway :D).

Click on the `Issues` tab above or just click [here](https://github.com/Bouncyrock/TaleSpire-Beta-Public-Issue-Tracker/issues)

Please note that we arent tracking feature requests here. Only things broken in current builds of TaleSpire.
